I am a Computer Science PhD student in the [Cambridge Logical Structures Hub (CLASH)][1]. My supervisor is [Jamie Vicary][2].

My research interests are focused around type theoretic approaches to higher category theory. Within this very broad area, I'm particularly interested in graphical calculi for higher categories.

A good example of a project I am proud to have worked on is [homotopy.io][3]. It is a proof assistant which allows one to do constructions in synthetic homotopy theory entirely through a graphical calculus for finitely-presented semistrict globular n-categories. I have contributed to the implementation of the software, and I'm currently working on new foundations for the tool, with the aim of increasing its expressive power.
